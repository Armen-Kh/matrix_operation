# matrix_operation
(A + B) * (C + D)
The goal of project is to make (A+B)*(C+D) matrix operation.
The project consists of three part.
The first part generates a matrix file with user defined parameters(matrix dimensions, matrix quantity in file). The matrices in file consist of integer elements from the interval [-99, 99].
The second part as an input takes four files, and as a result generates a result.txt, that contains results of the operation mentioned above.
The third part is testing. It implements a comparative analysis of two files: result.txt and origin txt.
